## DOOM for AIX 4.3+

This is my build of Chocolate DOOM 2.3 for IBM AIX 4.3, as shown in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzhCGSE7KKw

Source code for all modified packages are in src/*, see their respective
COPYING files. This may require libgcc from the IBM AIX Toolbox for AIX. I will add additional pulls as needed.
