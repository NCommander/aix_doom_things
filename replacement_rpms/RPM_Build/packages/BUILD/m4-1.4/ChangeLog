	be opened, return immediately after producing the error message.
	Reported by Andreas Schwab.

	* configure.in: Check for const only after having found possible

	Remove the sed filter after ansi2knr for debug.c.  Use $O instead
	of $U, put underline in extensions rather than in basenames.  Use
	implicit rules, now that regularity makes this possible.
	Have $(OBJECTS) depend on $(ANSI2KNR), so to trigger compilation
	of ansi2knr whenever it is needed.
	* configure.in: Adjusted for correct STACKOVF substitution.
	* src/debug.c (trace_format): When not __STDC__, use (...) as a

	* Makefile.in (install): Have install depend on all too, for lib
	to be remade as needed.

	* examples/stackovf.sh: Try ksh, bsh and bash for shells

	this way, a change in lib will be detected and processed.

	* builtin.c (numeric_arg): Use strtol and verify the conversion,
	instead of using sscanf which stops as soon as there is a
	non-digit in the input.  Previously, incr(1xyzzy), eval(1,2xyzzy)
	and divert(1xyzzy) were all accepted without any warning or error
	messages.
	* m4.h: Declare strtol as long if not including stdlib.h.

	adding support for SunOS/BSD (sigvec, sigstack, and 4-parameter signal
	handlers), and a default error message if the fault address is not 
	available (when neither siginfo.h nor BSD sigcontext are supported).
	* configure.in: Changes for stackovf.h: Check for sigcontext,
	sigaction, sigstack, and define rlim_t as int if necessary.

Sat Jul  2 00:58:47 1994  Francois Pinard  (pinard@icule)

	* configure.in: Remove dependency of USE_STACKOVF on STDC_HEADERS,
	because siginfo.h is unrelated to standard headers, and siginfo.h
	is already checked for.
	Reported by Joseph E. Sacco.

	* acconfig.h, aclocal.m4, m4.h: Replace HAVE_PROTOTYPES by
	PROTOTYPES.
	* aclocal.m4, configure.in: Replace AC_HAVE_PROTOTYPES by
	AC_PROTOTYPES.

Wed Jun 29 22:41:53 1994  Francois Pinard  (pinard@icule)

	* builtin.c (substitute): Use \& to represent this part of the
	string which was matched by the whole regexp, instead of
	representing the whole string.  Any usage of \0 issues a warning
	and acts like \&, it will disappear in some subsequent release.

Mon Jun 27 14:24:23 1994  Francois Pinard  (pinard@icule)

	* m4.c: Complete prototype for forwarded declaration of usage.

	* input.c (init_macro_token): Correct own reference in error
	message.  Previous name get_macro_func was referred to instead.
	(next_char):  Correct own reference in error message.  Previous
	name advance_input was referred to instead.

	* m4.h: Declare eval_t and unsigned_eval_t typedefs to 32 bits.
	* eval.c (logical_or_term, logical_and_term, or_term, xor_term,
	and_term, not_term, logical_not_term, cmp_term, shift_term,
	add_term, mult_term, exp_term, unary_term, simple_term): Add
	prototype to forwarded declarations.  Declare parameter v1 as
	eval_t * instead of int *.  Same for local variable v2 in dyadic
	functions.  Same for result in exp_term.
	* builtin.c (m4_eval): Declare value as eval_t instead of int.
	(ntoa): Declare value as eval_t instead of int.  Declare uvalue as
	unsigned_eval_t instead of unsigned int.  Change casts accordingly.

	Reported by Thorsten Ohl.	

	* macro.c: Complete the prototypes of forwarded expand_macro and
	expand_token.
	Reported by Thorsten Ohl.

	* m4.c (xfree):  Replace void * by voidstar.
	Reported by Tom McConnell.

	stamp-h does not exist yet.  This avoids running it a second time
	just after the initial ./configure.
	Reported by David MacKenzie and Tom McConnell.

	* m4.h: Replace the enum debug_info declaration with a series of
	#define's.  The Ultrix 3.1 compiler would otherwise need casting
	(int) to most references, when used in expressions.
	Reported by Tom McConnell.

Sat Jun 25 00:10:05 1994  Francois Pinard  (pinard@icule)

	* aclocal.m4: Replace FP_PROTOTYPES by AC_HAVE_PROTOTYPES,
	following an idea from Brook G. Milligan.  AC_HAVE_PROTOTYPES
	calls the compiler.  Previously, FP_PROTOTYPES was only calling
	the preprocessor; by not being subject to CFLAGS, this was
	discouraging those flags asking for ANSI compilation.
	* acconfig.h: Document HAVE_PROTOTYPES.
	* configure.in: Use AC_HAVE_PROTOTYPES instead of FP_PROTOTYPES.
	* m4.h: Define _() according to HAVE_PROTOTYPES, not __STDC__.
	Reported by Eric Backus.

	* configure.in: Substitute CFLAGS and LDFLAGS, taking their value
	from the environment.  Default CFLAGS to -g if not set.
	* Makefile.in: Have CFLAGS and LDFLAGS substituted from configure.
	* lib/Makefile.in: Have CFLAGS substituted from configure. 
	Reported by Eric Backus and Tom McConnell.

	* configure.in: m4_undefine changeword before using AC_ENABLE.

	* m4.h: Declare prototypes for error (for ANSI compilers only),
	prefix_all_builtins and reference_error.
	Reported by Tom McConnell.

	* input.c (set_word_regexp): Do not try to initialize the array
	test from a string, this does not work with non-ANSI compilers.
	Reported by Eric Backus.

	* Makefile.in (dist): Clean examples/ before saving it.
	(distclean-local): Also remove stamp-h.
	Reported by Eric Backus.

	* Makefile.in (_stackovf.c): Goal for compiling stacokovf.c with
	non ANSI compilers.
	Reported by Tom McConnell.

	* checks/Makefile.in (clean): Depends on mostlyclean.
	(mostlyclean): New goal.

	that Jim developped stackovf.c on a 486 running SVR4.0 (ESIX), and
	also tested it on a Sun Sparc workstation running SunOS 4.x.

	* format.c (format): When not HAVE_EFGCVT, m4 was failing the
	49.format check, abusing a `union values' argument with sprintf
	without selecting the proper field.  Now, save the formatting type
	first, delaying the fetch of the corresponding argument.
	Reported by Joseph E. Sacco and Tom Quinn.

	* format.c (format): Remove const from char *fmt declaration when
	not HAVE_EFGCVT, because a NUL may be forced into it.

	warning from gcc about `repl' possibly used before defined.
	Reported by Jim Meyering.

Tue Jan 25 18:39:37 1994  Francois Pinard  (pinard at icule)

	* m4.h: Move the conditional definition of volatile after the
	inclusion of system files, because they may define it first.

Tue Jan  4 19:46:50 1994  Francois Pinard  (pinard@icule)

	* checks/Makefile.in (CHECKS): Add a useless `*' before `[', to
	get around a problem with Alpha make seeing a syntax error, there.
	Reported by Vern Paxson.

	syserr() macro.  Delete errref, add reference_error and M4ERROR.
	* m4.c: Replace errref, which was returning an input reference
	string, with reference_error, which prints it on standard error.
	* builtin.c, output.c: Use errno as second parameter to error,
	instead of using syserr() with %s.
	* *.c: Use M4ERROR instead of error: no more errref() with %s.
	Doing so, the program name appears after the input reference
	instead of before, which eases M-x next-error processing.

Wed Nov 24 22:16:15 1993  Francois Pinard  (pinard@icule)

	* checks/get-them: Escape braces with backslashes in patterns,

	* builtin.c (m4_eval): Cast strlen to (int) before comparing.

	* input.c (input_init): Initialize quote and comment strings
	explicitely instead of calling set_quotes and set_comment: by

	this is not needed anymore.

	* m4.h: Declare extern FILE *debug.  Add DEBUG_PRINT{1,3} and
	DEBUG_MESSAGE{,1,2} macros.  Delete declarations for debug_print
	and debug_message, add declaration for debug_message_prefix.

	* Release 1.0.3
	This is still a	beta release for the future GNU m4 version 1.1.

	* lib/alloca.c: New, from elsewhere.
	* lib/Makefile.in: Distribute it.  Define and use $(ALLOCA).

	* m4.h: Do not define index/rindex if already defined.  If
	FALSE/TRUE are already defined, do not redefine them, but merely
	define boolean typedef to int.

	* Makefile.in: Use $(DEFS) while compiling ansi2knr.
	* ansi2knr.c: Rewrite #ifdef HAVE_STRING_H || STDC_HEADERS,
	because some C compilers do not like connectives with #ifdef.
	* m4.h: Define `volatile' only if __GNUC__, instead of once for
	__GNUC__ and once for __STDC__.
	* lib/regex.h: Leave const alone, AC_CONST will take care of it.

	* checks/Makefile.in: Use .all_stamp instead of $(CHECKS) for
	Makefile dependencies.  Without it, make keeps destroying and
	remaking $(CHECKS) in a loop (why?).  Distribute .all_stamp.

	* m4.h, m4.c, builtin.c, output.c: Change all divertion/DIVERTION
	to diversion/DIVERSION, this was a spelling error.

	* m4.c: Declare version[], remove #include "version.h".
	* version.h: Deleted.
	* Makefile.in: Remove references to version.h.

	* output.c (shipout_text): Centralize all `#line NUM ["FILE"]'
	production, by using a simpler and more robust algorithm.  This
	solves the problem of synclines sometimes written in the middle of
	an output line.  Delete sync_line() and output_lines variable.
	* m4.h: Remove sync_line prototype and output_lines declaration.
	* input.c (next_char), output.c (shipout_text): Remove references
	to output_lines.
	* input.c (push_file, pop_file): Merely put the value -1 in
	output_current_line instead of calling sync_line, for delaying a
	single `#line NUM FILE' before next output line.  Do not test
	for sync_output, because this is unnecessary clutter.
	* output.c (make_divertion, insert_divertion): Idem.
	* input.c: Rename must_advance_line to start_of_input_line, for
	consistency.

	* debug.c (trace_header): Select a new debug line format, which
	better complies with GNU standards for formatting error messages.
	With option `-dfl', M-x next-error might be used on the output.
	* m4.c (vmesg): Adjust format of error output to GNU standards.
	* m4.texinfo: Adjust examples for `make check' to work.

	* m4.h, builtin.c, debug.c, input.c, macro.c, path.c: Use upper
	case for enum debug_info constants, which were all lower case.

	* builtin.c (m4_regexp, m4_patsubst): Use re_search instead of
	re_search_2.
	* lib/regex.[ch]: Use new version from textutils 1.3.6, with some
	collected patches.  I tried a few times using newer regex.[ch], it
	mysteriously stopped aborting with this one.  Insecure feeling...
	* lib/Makefile.in: Distribute regex.[ch].old, just in case!

Fri Dec 18 11:08:03 1992  Francois Pinard  (pinard at icule)

	* m4.c: Change `--no-warnings' to `--silent'.
	Reported by David MacKenzie.

	* m4.c: Put all M4OPTS code upon IMPLEMENT_M4OPTS control, and
	leave it off for now.  See comment in m4.c for justification.
	Reported by David MacKenzie.

	* configure.in: Replace AC_USG by AC_HAVE_HEADERS(string.h).
	* m4.h, ansi2knr.c, lib/regex.h: Replace USG by HAVE_STRING_H.

	* Makefile.in: Add a new `info' goal.  Use macro MAKEINFO.

	* Makefile.in: Ensure recursive cleaning is done before local
	cleaning for all clean goals.

	* builtin.c (ntoa): Ensure the value is always interpreted as a
	signed quantity, whatever the radix is.

Wed Nov 18 07:57:19 1992  Jim Meyering  (meyering@idefix)

	* builtin.c, format.c, input.c: Split long lines.
	* m4.c: Use typedef macro_definition instead of struct
	macro_definition.

	* Makefile.in: Add $(AWK) to MDEFINES.
	* checks/Makefile.in: Transmit $(AWK) to get_them.
	* checks/get_them: Use $AWK instead of gawk.  Add a close in the
	awk script when switching files, because without this, mawk runs
	out of file descriptors.

Mon Nov 16 20:42:56 1992  Francois Pinard  (pinard at icule)

	* Makefile.in (realclean): Delete m4.info*.
	Reported by Jim Meyering.

	* Makefile.in: Adjust and link with checks/Makefile.
	* checks/Makefile.in: New.
	* configure.in: Output checks/Makefile.

	* checks/get_them: Have the dnl header of each test more
	recognizable by next-error, also use a better message.

Mon Nov 16 07:48:52 1992  Jim Meyering  (meyering@idefix)

        * m4.h [__GNUC__]: Use __volatile__ instead of `volatile.'
        And use that only if __GNUC__ since we're using it's GCC-specific
        semantics that tell the compiler the associated function doesn't
        return.

        * builtin.c (substitute): Don't use character as an array index.
        (dumpdef_cmp): Make formal arguments `const void *' to avoid
        warnings with gcc -W -Wall on systems with qsort prototype.
        (m4_errprint): Cast obstack_finish to `char *' to avoid warnings
        from gcc -W -Wall.

        * eval.c (most functions): Add parentheses to assignments used
        as truth values go avoid warnings from gcc -Wall.

	* input.c, m4.c, output.c, path.c, symtab.c: Declare static
	any functions that don't need external scope.

	* builtin.c, debug.c, format.c, m4.c, m4.h, macro.c, symtab.c
	(many functions and arrays): Declare `const'.

Sun Nov 15 09:42:09 1992  Francois Pinard  (pinard at icule)

	* *.[ch]: Rename nil to NULL, using the declaration from <stdio.h>,
	removing the declaration from m4.h.  Also rename false to FALSE
	and true to TRUE.

	* lib/Makefile.in (Makefile): New goal.

	* Makefile.in, lib/Makefile.in: Add a .c.o rule, so CFLAGS is not
	so heavily loaded.  It gets more easily overridable, calling make.
	Reported by Jim Meyering.

	* Makefile.in (dist): Get .fname from the current directory name,
	instead of from version.h.  I need updating many files manually,
	when the version changes, version.h is just one of them.

Sat Nov 14 11:01:20 1992  Francois Pinard  (pinard at icule)

	* m4.h: Remove the tag `boolean' on the enum introducing typedef
	`boolean'.  This tag conflicts with <sys/types.h> on SVR4.
	Reported by Tom McConnell.

Fri Nov 13 00:12:50 1992  Francois Pinard  (pinard at icule)

	* m4.texinfo: Correct the examples for 33.divert, 38.divnum,
	39.cleardiv, which were describing missing or spurious newlines.
	Modify examples 52.eval, 53.esyscmd and 54.sysval so the results
	do not depend on machine word size, `/bin/false' implementation,
	or `wc' output format.  `make check' is more dependable, now.

	* checks/check_them: Summarize the failed tests by listing their
	name, at end.  If none, issue `All checks successful'.  Output
	`Checking' instead of `Input file:'.

	* checks/get_them, checks/check_them: Reindented.

	* Makefile.in (dist): chmod a+r before making the tar file.

Thu Nov 12 14:42:57 1992  Francois Pinard  (pinard at icule)

	* builtin.c (m4_dnl): Diagnose any parameter to `dnl'.

	* input.c (next_token): Reinitialize token_buttom just after using
	it as a watermark with obstack_free.  Or else, a future token, big
	enough for triggering reallocation of the obstack chunk, could
	void the initialized value of token_buttom, later causing panic in
	obstack_free.  Rename token_buttom to token_bottom everywhere.

	* m4.h: Before declaring errno, first include <errno.h> and
	ensure that it does not define errno.
	Reported by Richard Stallman.

Wed Nov 11 17:40:35 1992  Francois Pinard  (pinard at icule)

	* builtin.c: Define and use DECLARE macro for builtins.

	* builtin.c (m4_ifelse): Avoid any diagnostic when exactly one
	argument, this is a common idiom for introducing long comments.

	* builtin.c (m4_ifelse): If 3n + 2 arguments, diagnose missing
	arguments.  The last argument was silently ignored.

	* m4.c (cmd_error): Add a missing semicolon before va_end().

Tue Nov 10 08:57:05 1992  Francois Pinard  (pinard at icule)

	* configure.in: Define U through FP_PROTOTYPES for old compilers.
	Add AC_ISC_POSIX, AC_CONST, AC_SIZE_T.
	* aclocal.m4: New, provide FP_PROTOTYPES.
	* m4.h: Conditionnaly protoized through Args, save for varags.
	* builtin.c: Protoized.  Then:
	Include <sys/types.h> if size_t is not defined, before "regex.h".
	(m4_ifelse): Fetch built-in name properly for diagnostic.
	(m4_dumpdef): Remove wrong (char *) cast calling dump_symbol.
	(m4_regexp): Add const to `msg' declaration.
	(m4_patsubst): Add const to `msg' declaration.
	* debug.c: Protoized, save for varargs.

	(xfree): Accept void * instead of char *.
	(xmalloc): Return void * instead of char *.
	(xrealloc): Accept and return void * instead of char *.
	* macro.c: Protoized.
	* output.c: Protoized.
	* path.c: Protoized.  Then cast some (char *) over xmalloc's.
	* symtab.c: Protoized.

Fri Nov  6 02:05:21 1992  Francois Pinard  (pinard at icule)

	* m4.texinfo: Remove directory from diagnostics in 30.include,
	51.eval, 56.errprint and 57.m4exit tests.

	* m4.h: Remove declarations for int or void system functions, they
	cause more conflicting trouble than they make good.

	* configure.in: Avoid configuration header file.  Add some tests.
	* m4.h: Remove #include "config.h".
	* Makefile.in, lib/Makefile.in: Implement Autoconf interface.
	Then, rewritten for better compliance with GNU standards.

Thu Nov  5 12:37:13 1992  Francois Pinard  (pinard at icule)

	* format.c (format): Avoid syntax error if not HAVE_EFGCVT,
	because of a misplaced #endif.

	usage message more informative.
	Reported by David MacKenzie.

Mon Mar  9 14:53:40 1992  Francois Pinard  (pinard at icule)

	* etc/check_examples: New name for check_examples.sh.
